A device must be rootable for it to be able to perform the mapping functions. The best way to accomplish this is use Android TVs (ATVs) as they have custom ROMs for MAD mapping. It is reccomended you get a device that supports 64bit as Niantic may be deprecating 32bit in the future.

.. warning::
  Android 10 is currently not supported!

For a list of confirmed devices that working with MAD, check out `this list <https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD-device-list>`_. Below are links to the configuration guides:
