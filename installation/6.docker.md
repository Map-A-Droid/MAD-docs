# Docker
In this wiki page we explain how to deploy MAD using docker.

## Get Docker
First of all, you have to install Docker CE and docker-compose on your system.

- Docker CE: just execute this script [https://get.docker.com/](https://get.docker.com/) - or read through [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 
- Docker-compose: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

These sites are well documented and if you follow the install instructions, you are good to go.


## 1 Setup MAD and Rocketmap database.
In this section we explain how to setup MAD and a Rocketmap database using docker-compose.

### 1.1 Preparations:

You can just copy & paste this to do what is written below: 
```
mkdir MAD-docker && \
cd MAD-docker && \
mkdir mad && \
mkdir mad/configs && \
touch docker-compose.yml && \
mkdir docker-entrypoint-initdb && \
wget -O docker-entrypoint-initdb/rocketmap.sql https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD/master/scripts/SQL/rocketmap.sql && \
cd mad/configs/ && \
touch mappings.json && \
wget -O config.ini https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD/master/configs/config.ini.example && \
mkdir geofences && cd ../../
```

This will: 
1. Create a directory `MAD-docker`. 
2. Create a file `docker-compose.yml`.
3. Create a directory `MAD-docker/mad`. (here we store MAD related stuff)
4. Create a directory `MAD-docker/mad/configs`. (here we store config files for MAD).
Here you store your `config.ini`, `mappings.json` and a directory `geofences` (which contains your geofences).
Examples for these files can be found @github https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD/tree/master/configs
5. Create a directory `MAD-docker/docker-entrypoint-initdb`
6. Download the Rocketmap Database Schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD/master/SQL/rocketmap.sql and store it
in the directory `docker-entrypoint-initdb`.

Your directory should now look like this:
 ``` 
 --MAD-docker/
  |-- docker-compose.yml
  |-- docker-entrypoint-initdb/
    |-- rocketmap.sql
  |-- mad/
    |-- configs/
      |-- config.ini
      |-- mappings.json
      |-- geofences/
 ```

If you start from scratch, add the following content to `mad/configs/mappings.json`:
``` 
{
    "areas": {
        "entries": {},
        "index": 0
    },
    "auth": {
        "entries": {},
        "index": 0
    },
    "devices": {
        "entries": {},
        "index": 0
    },
    "devicesettings": {
        "entries": {},
        "index": 0
    },
    "migrated": true,
    "monivlist": {
        "entries": {},
        "index": 0
    },
    "walker": {
        "entries": {},
        "index": 0
    },
    "walkerarea": {
        "entries": {},
        "index": 0
    }
}
```
If you have an existing `mappings.json`, because you used MAD before, then just copy it over.

 
### 1.2 Writing the docker-compose file.
We use `docker-compose` to deploy and manage our services.

Fill `docker-compose.yml` with the following content. Below we explain the details of every service.
```yaml
version: '2.4'
services:
  mad:
    container_name: pokemon_mad
    image: mapadroid/map-a-droid
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - ./mad/configs/geofences:/usr/src/app/configs/geofences
      - ./mad/configs/config.ini:/usr/src/app/configs/config.ini
      - ./mad/configs/mappings.json:/usr/src/app/configs/mappings.json
      - ./volumes/mad/files:/usr/src/app/files
      - ./volumes/mad/logs:/usr/src/app/logs
    depends_on:
      - rocket-db
    networks:
      - default
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "8000:8000"
      - "5000:5000"

  rocket-db:
    container_name: pokemon_rocketdb
    image: mariadb:10.3
    restart: always
    command: ['mysqld', '--character-set-server=utf8mb4', '--collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci']
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: StrongPassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: rocketdb
      MYSQL_USER: rocketdb
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: AnotherStrongPassword
      TZ: Europe/Berlin
    volumes:
      - ./volumes/rocketdb:/var/lib/mysql
      - ./docker-entrypoint-initdb:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
    networks:
      - default
```

The docker-compose file defines a set of services.
#### 1.2.1 The `mad` service
The `mad` service is a docker-container based on the image [mapadroid/map-a-droid](https://hub.docker.com/r/mapadroid/map-a-droid) , which is automatically built by dockerhub whenever a push to the `master` happens, using this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD/blob/master/Dockerfile).

In the docker-image, the whole MAD repository is located in `/usr/src/app`.


**Volumes:** 
- The volumes define what is mounted into the docker-container. 
- On one hand we mount the **configuration files (config.ini, mappings.json)** and the **geofences** we need. 
- On the other hand we "mount out" the **files/directories produced by MAD**, 
such as the directory `logs` and also the `files` directory, which contains all calculated routes, position files and stats. As usual,
volumes are needed for everything **you do not want to loose** after you take the docker-container down.
Without these volumes, MAD would have to recalculate the routes everytime you take your container up.

**Ports:**
- The docker-image exposes ports `8080` (RGC), `8000` (Pogodroid) and `5000` (Madmin) by default.
- We publish these ports and map them on ports of our host. 
So e.g. `https://your-domain.com:8080` will point to port `8080` of the container, `8000` to `8000` and `5000`to `5000`.
In this case in RGC you would put `https://your-domain.com:8080` as target, in pogodroid `http://your-domain.com:8000`
and madmin would be reachable under `https://your-domain.com:5000`.

#### 1.2.2 The `rocket-db` service.
The `rocket-db` service is docker-container based on [mariadb:10.3](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb).
It will start a mariadb database server and automatically create the defined used `MYSQL_USER` with password  `MYSQL_PASSWORD`.

**Your job here is to set secure passwords for `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD`.**

**The database is reachable in the default network as `rocket-db`, so in your config.ini it looks like this:**
```
dbip: rocket-db                      # IP adress or hostname of the mysql server
dbusername: rocketdb                 # USERname for database
dbpassword: AnotherStrongPassword    # Password for that username
dbname: rocketdb                     # Name of the database
```

- You can see that we mount the directory `docker-entrypoint-initdb` to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`,
All *.sql scripts in this directory are executed, once the container starts.


### 1.3 Deploy the Database for MAD
Let's deploy the database, shall we?
Just execute: 
``` 
docker-compose up -d rocket-db
```

This will start the `rocket-db` service and execute `rocketmap.sql` in `docker-entrypoint-initdb`.
Take a look at the logs: 
``` 
docker-compose logs -f rocket-db
```
and verify that the database was initialized without problems.


### 1.4 Deploy MAD
To deploy MAD you just execute 
``` 
docker-compose up -d mad
```

Look at the logs with:
``` 
docker-compose logs -f mad
```

## 2 Some useful commands to maintain MAD + DB
#### Dump DB:
``` 
docker-compose exec -T rocket-db /usr/bin/mysqldump -uroot -pStrongPassword rocketdb  > $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")_rocketmap_backup.sql
```

#### Restore DB:
```
cat <backup>.sql | docker-compose exec -T rocket-db /usr/bin/mysql -uroot -pStrongPassword rocketdb
```

#### mysql cli:
```
docker-compose exec rocket-db /usr/bin/mysql -uroot -pStrongPassword rocketdb
```


#### Update Stops / Gyms:
TODO.
We did not automize that yet, so stay tuned. 
I don't want to write all the steps we currently do^^

## 3 Some more useful docker stuff
- create an alias for `docker-compose` like `dc`, you will safe alot of time :P
- **Router:** we recommend [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/), which is really easy to use and also a docker-container ;)
To secure the docker-socket (which traefik has access to) we recommend the [docker-socket-proxy](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy) by Tecnativa.
- **Automatic updates:** [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) is a useful tool which will update your docker-services once there are newer images available.
- **Pokealarm, PMSF:** check out our docker-compose used here: [https://github.com/Breee/pogo-map-package]()
