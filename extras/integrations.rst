Webhook tools
=============

MAD is able to send the scanned data via webhook to third party software.

PokeAlarm
---------

PokeAlarm (PA) is the most common tool. It relays almost anything to several types of chats like Telegram or Discord. It also provides a lot of filter possibilities to configure it to anyone's needs.

PoracleJS
---------

PoracleJS is based on running a Discord or Telegram bot that will either send events to a group/channel or as a private message to you. So every user can set their own filters. Poracle is able to send mon, raids and quests.

novabot
-------

Novabot is a Discord bot that doesn't actually use webhooks. It pulls the data directly from the database. Just like Poracle, novabot is configurable for each user individually. It's able to post mon, raids and has a raid coordination system built-in.
