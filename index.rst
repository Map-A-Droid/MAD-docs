MAD
-------------------
MAD is the software running on your server. Devices connect to it and will then be controlled by the server.

Android devices
---------------
The device needs run the game, must be rooted, pass the `SafetyNet Check <https://koz.io/inside-safetynet>`_ and SELinux must be permissive or moderate. To root your device, use `Magisk <https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-magisk>`_.

Remote GPS Controller (RGC)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RGC is an app developed by the MAD team to control the device in various ways. It handles the GPS spoofing, touch/text inputs, app starts/stops etc.

PogoDroid (PD)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This app injects into the running game process and relays the data being sent to the game to the MAD server. A valid token is required to use it, you can purchase it on `the MAD website <https://www.maddev.eu>`_.
